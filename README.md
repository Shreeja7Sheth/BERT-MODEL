# BERT-MODEL

The Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model can be used for email spam classification: 

-   How it works: BERT uses a transformer, an attention mechanism, to learn the contextual relationships between words in a text. The transformer's encoder reads the entire sequence of words at once, allowing the model to learn a word's context based on its surroundings. 
-   Performance: BERT has achieved state-of-the-art performance on various natural language processing tasks. 
-   Use cases: BERT can be used for real-time spam classification, fake news detection, and inadequate content filtering. 
-   Training: BERT is trained on a dataset of spam and ham (non-spam) messages. 
-   Model selection: The BERT base model is often used for building spam detectors. 
-   Hybrid techniques: Hybrid techniques that combine deep learning and conventional algorithms can be used to improve the accuracy of the classifier.
